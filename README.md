# Connect4
Text Based Game of Connect 4
Game utilises inheritence, interfaces and a range of different classes.
To play the game you first pick a character to represent you and a character to represent your opponent.
Then you play and try to connect 4 of your own characters in a line, whether straight or diagonal.
Game is run from Connect4Game.
I do plan on making a GUI for the game and making the AI smart in the future.
